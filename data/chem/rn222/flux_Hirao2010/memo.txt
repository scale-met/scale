This file is readme file of a directory named "data/chem/rn222/flux_Hirao2010".
Using the information in this file, you can get a global map of Rn-222 flux by Hirao et al. (2010) and arrange it for SCALE simulation.

1. How to get flux data
The Rn-222 flux data is published from a web site (http://www.ees.nagoya-u.ac.jp/~env_eng/data/flux_hirao/index.html).
To use the data by SCALE, you should firstly get data named flux_hirao2010.tar.gz

2. Uncompress the file at directry that you want to put the flux data, then, a "flux_hirao2010" created after the uncompress.

3. In your simulation by SCALE, you should specify the directory, which contains data files, in the configure file.

 ATMOS_SFC_CH_Rn222_HIRAO2010_dirpath = '#path_to_the_data_directory#',
