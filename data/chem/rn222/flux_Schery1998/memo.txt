This file is readme file of a directory named "data/chem/rn222/flux_Schery1998".
Using the information in this file, you can get a global map of Rn-222 flux by Schery and Wasiolec (1998) and arrange it for SCALE simulation.

1. How to get flux data
The Rn-222 flux data is published from a web site (http://infohost.nmt.edu/~schery/mapdata.html).
To use the data by SCALE, you should firstly get data named fdh3a.xx (xx is from 00 to 12).

2. In your simulation by SCALE, you should specify the directory, which contains data files, in the configure file.

&PARAM_ATMOS_SFC_CH_RN222
 ATMOS_SFC_CH_Rn222_emission_type      = 'SCHERY1998',
 ATMOS_SFC_CH_Rn222_SCHERY1998_dirpath = '#path_to_the_data_directory#',
