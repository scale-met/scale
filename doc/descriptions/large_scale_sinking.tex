In the DYCOMS01 experiment, the large scale sinking is added
to express large scale downward motion corresponding to the Haddley circulation.
The motion converges virtually and results mass escape to out of the system.

The density loss rate is constant $L$:
\begin{equation}
  L = -\frac{\partial \rho w_L}{\partial z},
\end{equation}
where $w_l$ is vertical velocity corresponding to the large scale sinking.
Then vertical momentum with the sinking is
\begin{equation}
  \rho w_L = -Lz.
\end{equation}

Continuous equation is now
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial z}
  + \frac{\partial \rho u}{\partial x}
  + \frac{\partial \rho v}{\partial y}
  + \frac{\partial \rho (w+w_L)}{\partial z}
  = -L.
  \label{eq: lls rho}
\end{equation}

Lagrangian conservation equation for scalar quantities are
\begin{equation}
  \rho\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t}
  + \rho u\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x}
  + \rho v\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial y}
  + \rho (w+w_L)\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial z}
  = 0,
\end{equation}
and becomes with eq. (\ref{eq: lls rho})
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial \rho\phi}{\partial t}
  + \frac{\partial \rho u \phi}{\partial x}
  + \frac{\partial \rho v \phi}{\partial y}
  + \frac{\partial \rho (w+w_L) \phi}{\partial z}
  = -L\phi.
\end{equation}

The equations for mixing ratio is
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial \rho Q}{\partial t}
  + \frac{\partial \rho Q u }{\partial x}
  + \frac{\partial \rho Q v}{\partial y}
  + \frac{\partial \rho Q (w+w_L)}{\partial z}
  = -L Q.
\end{equation}
Note that this is identical to that of scalar quantities.

The $w_L$ at the top boundary is not zero while $w$ is zero.
The vertical flux $\rho w_L \phi$ at the top layer interface could be determined as
that convergence of the flux is canceled with $L\phi$.
