\section{Introduction} \label{sec:introduction}
%==============================================================%
This user's manual is intended for first-time users
of the regional climate/weather forecasting model \scalerm.
The manual is based on
the meteorology/climate library {\scalelib} version \version.
The current version of \scalelib contains a regional model \scalerm
and a global model \scalegm.
Only a dynamical core is provided for the latter.
This version of the user's manual explains how to use \scalerm in detail.
A description of \scalegm is planned for the next release.

The structure of this document is as follows:
Chapter \ref{chap:overview} provides an overview of \scalelib,
Chapter \ref{chap:install} describes how to install \scalerm
along with the system requirements. Using simple examples,
Chapters \ref{chap:tutorial_ideal} and \ref{chap:tutorial_real} use examples and explain the basic use of \scalerm in an ideal experiment and the method
to conduct an atmospheric experiment, respectively. Since these chapters are constructed as a series of tutorials, it is recommended that beginning users of \scalerm read these chapters meticulously.
Chapter \ref{chap:basic_usel} describes how to change the model configuration, and explains various functions and tools.

\subsection{What is \scalelib?} \label{subsec:scale_feature}
%--------------------------------------------------------------%

Scalable Computing for Advanced Library and Environment, called {\scalelib}, is a software library that helps conduct research on climate and weather forecasting on any computer with ease. 
This library covers all processes related to such research: 
pre-processing, simulation, post-processing, and analysis. 
It has the following advantages:
\begin{itemize}
\item 
\scalelib is provided as an open-source software under the `` BSD-2 license.''. It is free for use, modification, and redistribution, regardless of whether the user is a business or other enterprise.
\item 
\scalelib contains a regional model called the \scalerm ( SCALE-Regional Model ).
\item 
\scalelib prepares various schemes in a component, as outlined in the next section. They can be appropriately chosen according to the desired experiments of users.
\item 
\scalelib provides a framework for physical processes that can be called not only by \scalerm, but also by other numerical models.
\end{itemize}
For the details of the license, the interested reader can refer to the file \texttt{scale-\version/LICENSE} under the main directory. This explanation of its use is also provided on the SCALE webpage (http://scale.aics.riken.jp/). 

In this section, the concept of \scalelib and its relations to actual models are explained. It can be skipped, as it is not related directly to its practical use.

\end{figure}

\scalelib was developed in RIKEN/AICS with several outside contributors,
and its improvement and extension continue.
Figure \ref{fig:scale} shows the schematic concept of \scalelib.
As shown in this figure, SCALE aims to resolve various problems.
The development of \scalelib is considered in the context of its wide use
by devices ranging from small PC clusters to next-generation supercomputers.
For this purpose, scientists in meteorology/climate science
and computer science are cooperating.
This has led to high computational performance of SCALE not only in supercomputers,
such as the K Computer and the Fujitsu FX10,
but also for general-purpose commercial computers,
such as Intel processor-based machines.

\scalerm is a numerical model that fully uses \scalelib.
This model is contained in the \scalelib package,
as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:scale-rm}.
\scalelib manages the parallel processes,
file I/O, and inner-communication.
\scalelib also provides the solver for atmospheric flow ( dynamical core )
and physical processes such as micro-physics and radiation processes.
On the other hand,
\scalerm is constructed by combining functions provided by \scalelib.
\scalerm itself reads the input data of atmospheric status as prognostic variable,
and conducts time-integration.
Users can select a scheme in every component according to simulations they want.

\subsection{Structure of \scalerm}  \label{subsec:sturcture_scale_rm}
%--------------------------------------------------------------%
All schemes in all components of \scalelib are available in \scalerm.
The components are categorized into three parts:
framework, dynamical core, and physical processes.
Components with various schemes already implemented
in the current version of \scalerm are listed below\footnote{Refer to \citet{scale_2015},\citet{satoy_2015b}, and \citet{nishizawa_2015} for the details of the model structure and the descretization method.}.

\subsubsection{Framework}
\begin{itemize}
 \item The three-dimensional (3D) Cartesian grid system based on actual distance
 \item 2D domain decomposition by Message Passing Interface (MPI) communication
 \item Several map projections commonly used
 \item Domain nesting system ( one-way, i.e., data transfer from parent domain to child domain. )
   \begin{itemize}
    \item  On-line nesting: concurrent execution of multiple domains).
    \item  Offline nesting: execution of computation in an inner domain after that in an outer domain.
   \end{itemize}
 \item Collective execution system of multiple cases, i.e., bulk job system
 \item \netcdf file I/O based on CF (Climate and Forecast) convention\footnote{\url{http://cfconventions.org/}}
   \begin{itemize}
   \item Selection of {\netcdf}3 and {\netcdf}4 formats
