This is simple configuration generator for SCALE-RM.

Usage:
  1. Edit the file "USER.sh".
  2. Use run command `make`.
  3. Generate "experiment" directory and the configuration files in it automatically.

When you stop this generator in process, you may see some junk files.
You can use run command `make clean` and clean these junk files up.
`make clean` does not remove "experiment" directory.
