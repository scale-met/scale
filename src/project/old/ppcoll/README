Compiled library files
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
libpapi.bin.cent6.2.tar.gz
libpapi.bin.suse11.tar.gz

If you want to run on the local server, extract libpapi.***.tar.gz
file suited to your environment. Edit Makedef.papi, and set a location
of extracted library files.



These libraries will work only on the newer operation kernel,
but will not work on the RHEL 5.x series (included AICS cluster).
In this case, please compile PAPI by yourself to suite your environment.

15 	HOW TO INSTALL PAPI ONTO YOUR SYSTEM
16 	*****************************************************************************
17 	
18 	On some of the systems that PAPI supports, you can install PAPI right
19 	out of the box without any additional setup. Others require drivers or
20 	patches to be installed first.
21 	
22 	The general installation steps are below, but first find your particular
23 	Operating System's section for any additional steps that may be necessary.
24 	NOTE: the configure and make files are located in the papi/src directory.
25 	
26 	General Installation
27 	
28 	1. % ./configure
29 	% make
30 	
31 	2. Check for errors.
32 	
33 	a) Run a simple test case: (This will run ctests/zero)
34 	
35 	% make test
36 	
37 	If you get good counts, you can optionally run all the test programs
38 	with the included test harness. This will run the tests in quiet mode,
39 	which will print PASSED, FAILED, or SKIPPED. Tests are SKIPPED if the
40 	functionality being tested is not supported by that platform.
41 	
42 	% make fulltest (This will run ./run_tests.sh)
43 	
44 	To run the tests in verbose mode:
45 	
46 	% ./run_tests.sh -v
47 	
48 	3. Create a PAPI binary distribution or install PAPI directly.
49 	
50 	a) To install PAPI libraries and header files from the build tree:
51 	
52 	% make install
53 	
54 	b) To install PAPI manual pages from the build tree:
55 	
56 	% make install-man
57 	
58 	c) To install PAPI test programs from the build tree:
59 	
60 	% make install-tests
61 	
62 	d) To install all of the above in one step from the build tree:
63 	
64 	% make install-all
65 	
66 	e) To create a binary kit, papi-<arch>.tgz:
67 	
68 	% make dist
